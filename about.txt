# Restaurant Sales Analysis Project

## Data Overview
The dataset contains daily restaurant sales information including:
- Key Metrics:
  - inside_sales: Revenue from indoor dining
  - outside_sales: Revenue from outdoor dining
  - inside_covers: Number of indoor customers
  - outside_covers: Number of outdoor customers
  - reserved_covers: Pre-booked customers
  - walkin_covers: Walk-in customers
  - waitlist_covers: Customers on waitlist
  - no_show_covers: Number of no-shows
  - no_show_parties: Number of parties that didn't show
  - no_show_cover_rate: Rate of no-shows

## Data Characteristics
1. Time Period:
   - Start Date: January 2017
   - End Date: May 2019
   - Frequency: Daily data

2. Key Features:
   - Sales data for both indoor and outdoor service
   - Customer flow metrics (reservations, walk-ins, waitlist)
   - No-show analytics
   - Seasonal patterns (can be analyzed for weekly/monthly trends)

## Project Objectives
1. Time Series Analysis:
   - Analyze sales trends and patterns
   - Identify seasonality (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Test for stationarity
   - Decompose time series components

2. Sales Forecasting:
   - ARIMA Model: For basic trend and pattern analysis
   - SARIMA Model: To capture seasonal patterns
   - Compare model performances
   - Generate reliable future sales predictions

3. Business Insights:
   - Peak sales periods
   - Sales patterns correlation with covers
   - Impact of no-shows on revenue
   - Indoor vs outdoor sales comparison

## Modeling Approach
1. Data Preparation:
   - Handle missing values appropriately
   - Remove or interpolate outliers
   - Create continuous time series
   - Feature engineering if needed

2. Model Development:
   - ARIMA:
     - Simple, non-seasonal modeling
     - Captures basic trends
   - SARIMA:
     - Incorporates seasonal components
     - Weekly patterns (7-day seasonality)
     - Monthly patterns if present

3. Model Comparison:
   - Error Metrics:
     - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
     - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
   - Visualization of forecasts
   - Residual analysis

## Expected Challenges
1. Data Quality:
   - Missing values (especially in outdoor sales)
   - Outliers from special events
   - Seasonal closures or holidays

2. Model Selection:
   - Multiple seasonal patterns
   - Changing trends over time
   - External factors not captured in data

3. Business Factors:
   - Special events impact
   - Weather effects on outdoor sales
   - Changing customer patterns
